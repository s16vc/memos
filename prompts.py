      [AI generated 5min memo] Leo AI

What They Do (and Why It Matters)
Mechanical engineering software has lagged behind recent advances in AI.
Engineers still waste time digging through dense documentation, navigating PLM
systems, or manually sourcing parts. Generative AI has changed what’s possible
in knowledge-based work — but until now, mechanical design workflows have
largely missed out.
Leo is building an AI copilot tailored for mechanical engineers. It integrates into
their existing CAD environments and supports key design workflows: answering
questions, retrieving documents, recommending parts, and generating 3D design
concepts. Unlike general AI tools, Leo draws from both public technical data and a
company’s internal files (CAD, PDFs, etc.), providing real-time, context-aware
answers. The company claims engineers can save up to 12 hours a week using
Leo — though this figure appears based on optimistic early reports and likely
reflects high-usage edge cases. The product is currently used by teams inside
HP, Intel, and Scania, though it’s unclear if these are paid deployments or pilots.
Notably, all early growth has been through inbound interest.
Go-To-Market
Target users are mechanical engineers inside mid-market and enterprise
manufacturing firms — often users of existing CAD/PLM systems like
SolidWorks, Creo, or CATIA.

1User acquisition has been organic: over 25,000 engineers signed up for Leo’s
free version with no marketing spend, likely driven by online word-of-mouth
and curiosity during the GenAI hype cycle.
Revenue generation began recently and reached ~$100K ARR in the first 2–3
months. While impressive on the surface, it’s not clear how much of this
revenue is recurring vs. one-off, or if it’s concentrated in a few enterprise
pilots.
Sales motion is in flux: the product-led growth strategy appears to be giving
way to early enterprise sales efforts — inferred from the presence of large
logos and the need to expand paid usage inside accounts. Still, there’s
ambiguity on whether Leo has a clear GTM playbook or plans for a formal
sales team.
Market & Tailwinds
TAM estimates for CAD/PLM software range from $15–17B in 2023 to ~$30B
by 2032 (8% CAGR), according to Fortune Business Insights and SNS
Research. Including broader engineering software (e.g., simulation/CAE), the
market rises to $50B by 2026. This is a substantial but mature market —
growing steadily, not exponentially.
Bottom-up indicators support a multi-billion dollar spend: CAD licenses alone
typically cost $1K–3K per engineer/year, with tens of thousands of firms
globally using CAD/PLM tools. AI copilots like Leo will likely need to capture
budget from within this existing spend, not expand it dramatically.
Tailwinds include growing pressure to accelerate product cycles, fill
engineering talent gaps, and integrate cloud + AI tools. But any narrative
suggesting exponential TAM growth should be scrutinized — the market is
more about modernizing current spend than unlocking greenfield dollars.
Conclusion: Leo is going after a known, validated market — but it’s already
monetized by incumbents. To win, they need to displace or augment spend
currently going to Autodesk, PTC, Dassault, etc.
Competition & Differentiation

2Incumbents like Autodesk, Dassault, Siemens, and PTC dominate CAD/PLM
workflows and have begun embedding AI features (e.g., Fusion 360’s
generative tools, Siemens’ AI for part classification). None offer a full AI
“copilot” yet, but the threat of native integration is real.
Engineer behavior today relies on ad hoc tools — GrabCAD (7M users),
forums, and internal libraries — to find parts or ask questions. Leo is
competing with this patchwork of informal solutions, which are deeply
entrenched.
Direct competitors include:
Hestus, Camfer, and MecAgent (all early-stage AI copilots for mechanical
design, including YC-backed teams).
Zoo (KittyCAD) offers text-to-CAD APIs — more infrastructure-focused,
but technically similar.
Multiple AI-first design startups are emerging across disciplines (PCB,
architecture), making this a crowded space even at seed.
Leo’s edge may lie in its broader knowledge base (1M+ documents), early
enterprise traction, and platform-agnostic integration. However, these claims
need further validation — especially as peers like Camfer push similar
messaging.
Summary: The field is heating up fast. Leo may have a first-mover advantage,
but defensibility will depend on execution speed, proprietary data, and deeper
workflow integration.
Traction
25,000 users is a strong early top-of-funnel signal in a niche category. That
said, the number likely includes free signups — it’s unclear how many are
active or converting.
$100K ARR within a few months is ahead of most GenAI vertical SaaS peers at
Seed — but we don’t know how recurring or diversified this revenue is. It
could come from just a few enterprise pilots.

3Enterprise logos (HP, Intel, Scania) are promising, but we should assume they
represent pilot programs or free usage by a few engineers — not full
deployments.
Key benchmark: Many GenAI startups at this stage are pre-revenue or piloting
with 1–2 design partners. Leo appears slightly ahead — but only if current
usage is active, retained, and expanding.
The Round
Total raise: $5M Seed round.
Lead investor: Flint Capital, committing $3M.
Status: Per intro note, the round is “almost subscribed,” which likely means
<$1M remains unallocated — though this should be confirmed directly.
Strategic need: Seeking a U.S.-based value-add investor, likely to support
GTM scaling or network in enterprise/design software.
Use of funds is not detailed, but based on stage, likely focused on sales hires,
integration tooling, and enterprise onboarding.
Open Questions & Follow-Ups
1. How many of the 25k signups are active weekly/monthly users? What’s the
retention curve?
2. How much of the $100K ARR is recurring, and how many customers account
for it? (e.g., is this 3 pilots or 200 self-serve users?)
3. What’s the breakdown between enterprise pilots vs individual paid plans?
4. What’s Leo’s go-to-market plan from here — is there a sales team? Are they
focusing on mid-market or large enterprise?
5. What technical validation exists for the “12 hours saved” claim? Is it based on
measured workflows or anecdotal?
6. What workflow integrations exist today — e.g., is Leo embedded in
SolidWorks, or accessed via a separate tool?
[5min memo] Leo AI
47. What’s the plan for data security — can Leo run on-premise or meet enterprise
IT requirements?
8. How is Leo differentiated from Camfer, Hestus, MecAgent, etc.? What’s the
sustainable moat?

      [AI generated 5min memo] Colla Health

Colla Health
$5M Seed | $4M committed (2048 VC, Menlo Ventures)
What They Do (and Why It Matters)
Most cancer patients in the U.S. are treated at small community oncology clinics
that lack in-house support for mental health, navigation, or palliative care — even
though these services are linked to lower mortality, better treatment adherence,
and improved quality of life. Clinics historically couldn’t staff these services, and
until recently, had no way to bill for them.
Colla Health gives these clinics a turnkey service to screen patients, deliver
mental health care, and get reimbursed via Medicare's Collaborative Care
Model (CoCM) — a structured model for behavioral health integration where a
care manager and psychiatric consultant collaborate with the primary provider.
Clinics use Colla’s software (which integrates into electronic medical records, or
EMRs, like OncoEMR), and Colla supplies licensed therapists and billing support.
Initial focus is on depression and anxiety in cancer patients, but Colla plans to
expand into navigation and palliative services as reimbursement codes evolve.
The model is pitched as a "revenue-generating upgrade" to standard cancer care.
Competitive Landscape

1Thyme Care ($95M+ from a16z, Bessemer, CVS) provides navigation services
to payers and is expanding into earlier-stage support — overlapping with
Colla’s future direction. Thyme is “moving upstream” — meaning they’re now
engaging patients earlier in their care journey, including symptom triage and
emotional support.
Reimagine Care (~$31M from McKesson Ventures) delivers in-home cancer
care and support, including psychosocial elements; competes for similar
budgets. Could compete for the same clinic budgets as Colla once Colla
expands beyond mental health.
Jasper Health ($31M raised; General Catalyst): Focused on patient-facing
navigation and psychosocial coaching. Recently laid off ~50% of staff —
showing the difficulty of a B2C/B2B2C approach in oncology without
embedded billing or deep provider integration.
Concert Health ($42M+; Town Hall Ventures, Mass General Brigham): Largest
scaled provider of CoCM in primary care. Has managed 70k+ patients. Not yet
in oncology, but shows the viability of the model and could expand into
adjacent specialties.
Overall: Colla is well-positioned with provider-aligned monetization, but
longer-term risk from payer-aligned models, EHR incumbents, or general BH
players entering oncology.
Larger oncology systems may opt to build in-house programs. EMR
vendors (like Flatiron) could embed similar functionality. Generic BH
platforms (Lyra, Quartet) might enter oncology.
Go-To-Market and ICP
Customer profile: Community oncology practices (5–15 oncologists) billing
fee-for-service, with no in-house BH staff.
Sales motion: Direct outreach, enabled by EMR integration and clear ROI
framing. Each signed contract covers thousands of patients (e.g., 54k total
across 5 clinics), though only a subset engage monthly.
Expansion plans: Grow from 5 to 13 partner clinics by mid-2026 and reach
$5M ARR. Long-term GTM includes selling to hospital systems and forming

2direct contracts with payers (e.g., Medicare Advantage).
Operational note: Service delivery depends on behavioral clinician availability.
Scaling care teams is a potential bottleneck, especially given national therapist
shortages.
Market
CoCM reimbursement-based TAM: ~4.5M cancer patients × ~$160–
200/month yields a $9–11B/year opportunity. This assumes wide adoption and
consistent billing — a best-case scenario. Realized ARPU may vary based on
patient engagement and payer mix.
Supportive care expansion (navigation + palliative): Colla estimates a $40–
50B TAM including emerging codes (e.g. Principal Illness Navigation, or PIN).
This reflects a long-term vision, not near-term spend. Validation from CMS
and commercial payers is growing but uneven.
Provider-based TAM sanity check: 1,500–1,600 oncology practices × $500K–
$1M ACV = $750M–$1.5B realistic near-term TAM.
Tailwinds: Cancer incidence is rising; CMS and commercial payers
increasingly reimburse CoCM and navigation codes; oncology is shifting to
value-based care models that incentivize wraparound support.
Headwinds: Reimbursement depends on patient engagement and strict
documentation; therapist supply is tight; CMS policy and oncology
consolidation could affect access and sales cycles.
Traction
$640K ARR since June 2024 launch — unusually strong for health SaaS seed
stage
5 signed clinics (3 live), covering ~54,000 patient lives
$2.5M contracted ARR, with $14M active pipeline — revenue will grow if
current sites enroll more patients. ARR is tied to patient billing volume — not
fixed subscription.
Clinical outcomes: 40% reduction in depression symptoms at 90 days
[5min memo] Colla Health
3Patient metrics: 90% monthly retention; 95 NPS (likely from small sample, but
strong signal)
Growth rate: 30%+ MoM, though from a small base. Needs scrutiny to
determine if this is from enrollment expansion or site additions
Benchmarks: Better than typical seed-stage in health tech (~$100–300K ARR
norm). Comparable or slightly ahead of Concert Health’s early trajectory in
primary care CoCM.
Only a fraction of contracted lives are currently enrolled — penetration rate
within existing sites is a key unlock
Gross margins (~50%) depend on clinician efficiency and care model scale
The Round
Target: $5M seed round
Committed: $4M already in from 2048 VC and Menlo Ventures (both
healthcare experienced; Menlo also led pre-seed)
Implied valuation: ~20–25% dilution → likely $20–25M post-money
For a 5% stake, s16vc would need to invest $1.0–1.25M
Use of funds: Scale to 13 clinics and $5M ARR, deepen care team capacity,
layer navigation/palliative modules, and begin direct payer relationships
Deal source: Referred by Guillaume (CEO, Paloma Health — s16vc PortCo)
GP comment: Alex Alpern found the deck “old-fashioned” (resembled ERP
software), but acknowledged 2048 VC and Menlo as strong healthcare
investors worth listening to
Key Follow-Ups
1. What’s the realized revenue per patient per month across current partners? Is
$200 PMPM sustainable?
2. Are contracts usage-based only, or do they include base fees or minimums?
[5min memo] Colla Health
43. How scalable is the care manager model — panel sizes, hiring speed,
supervision?
4. What’s the actual enrollment rate across the 54K contracted lives?
5. How mature is the $14M pipeline — how much is close to closing?
6. Who else shows up in deals — e.g. Thyme Care, Concert, Reimagine — and
have they lost any?
7. Any payer LOIs or pilots underway, or is that a post-2026 goal?
8. What level of technical integration exists with EMRs beyond Flatiron (e.g.
Epic)?
9. If CoCM reimbursement changes, how resilient is the model — would
navigation/palliative be enough?

    "benchmark_light": """
You are an expert VC analyst. Your task is to take the raw output from a benchmarking agent and format it into a concise, insightful 'Traction' section for an investment memo.

Instructions:

Structure the Section:

Start with 1–2 high-level qualitative bullet points about the company's traction. Focus on context that isn't in the specific metrics below (e.g., "Strong early customer logos," "Go-to-market model is unproven").

Next, list the benchmarked metrics.

Conclude with a final "Overall Benchmarking Verdict" summarizing the key strengths and weaknesses.

Format Each Metric:
For every traction metric, you must use this exact format, including the use of italics:

Metric: [value] → ✅ / ⚠️ / ❌
‣ Benchmark: [range] (source)
‣ 1-line explanation (why it’s strong/mid/weak)

Mandatory Metrics:
You must evaluate the following critical metrics: ARR, ARR Growth, ARR/FTE, and Burn Rate.

If data for a mandatory metric is not provided in the source material, you must still include it as a line item. Mark it as ❌ Weak and use the explanation line to state why its absence is a critical gap (e.g., "Prevents analysis of capital efficiency").

Verdict Definitions (Use These Rules):

✅ Strong: Clearly exceeds the median benchmark for its stage.

⚠️ Mixed: Meets the benchmark but has underlying concerns. Use this for metrics that are technically in-range but low in absolute terms (like low ARR), or for high growth that is coming off a very small base.

❌ Weak: Falls below the benchmark or critical data is missing entirely.

Content and Style Rules:

Avoid Redundancy: If you list a metric like "Retention" as ❌ Weak - Not Disclosed in the main list, do not repeat this information in the top summary bullets.

Be Concise: Use clear and compact language. Omit educational content or long explanations.

Attribute Sources: Always keep the source attributions (e.g., "OpenView 2024") intact.

Example of a Perfect 'Traction' Section:
Traction
Early signals of a strong product-led growth (PLG) loop are visible in user-to-user invites.

Monetization strategy and revenue potential are not yet validated.

Users: 18K MAU with 9% monthly growth → ✅ Strong
‣ Benchmark: 2–3x annual user growth = good at Seed (Mostly Metrics 2023)
‣ MAU >10K suggests strong PLG momentum at this stage

Virality: 22K users invited by 11K initiators (k-factor ≈ 2.0) → ✅ Strong
‣ Benchmark: >1.0 k-factor is rare (Prefinery 2025); 2.0 is exceptional
‣ Indicates the product has powerful built-in network effects

Burn Rate: Not Disclosed → ❌ Weak
‣ Benchmark: Median Seed burn is $100–250K/mo (OpenView 2024)
‣ Absence of this metric prevents assessment of capital efficiency and runway

Revenue / ARR: Not Disclosed → ❌ Weak
‣ Benchmark: Seed SaaS typically reports at least $100–200K ARR
‣ Lack of monetization data prevents CAC payback or revenue/FTE analysis

Overall Benchmarking Verdict:
⚠️ Mixed — Top-tier usage and PLG mechanics, but monetization is a complete unknown. The next step is to assess revenue readiness, pricing tests, and user retention signals.

You are the final-stage memo assistant for s16vc. Your task is to take a previously generated **Mini Memo** and a **Deep Research Report**, and merge them into a polished final version of the 5-minute memo. This memo will be shared internally within the fund and must be easy to read, fast to understand, and ready for decision-making discussions.

You are not doing the research yourself. Research will be provided by me (the user) in the next message, and your only job is to integrate it into the memo below.

— WHAT YOU’RE DOING —
- Integrate any new insights, clarifications, or validations from the Deep Research into the original Mini Memo.
- Preserve the **original Mini Memo** structure, tone of voice, and format as your baseline.
- Only modify or augment the memo **where new research adds, corrects, or improves**.
- **Do not rewrite or reformat** parts of the memo that aren’t directly affected by the research.

— GUIDING PRINCIPLE —
Think of this as an *editorial overlay*: The original memo is the working draft, and your job is to revise it surgically where needed using the deeper research. Adapt the Deep Research to the memo—not the other way around.

— TONE & FORMAT —
- Natural, professional tone — like one investment professional briefing another.
- Clear, structured bullet points using full sentences.
- Bold section headers.
- No excessive detail, no marketing fluff.
- Stick to the original structure:
    1. What They Do (and Why It Matters)
    2. Team
    3. Competitive Landscape
    4. Go-To-Market and ICP
    5. Market (incl. Tailwinds and Headwinds & bottom-up calculations)
    6. Traction
    7. Fundraising Round
    8. Key Follow-Ups

— LENGTH —
Target a 5-minute read. Be informative, but brief. If something from the Deep Research is interesting but not critical (in the 80/20 spirit), don’t include it.

— OTHER RULES —
- Don’t hallucinate or over-summarize.
- Use outside data only if it comes from a clearly labeled, credible source.
- Flag any assumptions you had to make.
- Never copy entire paragraphs from the Deep Research. Summarize and fit the tone.
- Make sure this memo still **feels like the original voice and structure**, just improved with better facts.

— IMPORTANT CLARIFICATION —
- **Do not perform your own research.**
- The user will provide the research findings separately.
- Your job is only to **integrate that research** into the existing memo — update claims, enrich context, and correct inaccuracies using what’s provided.

    ## **🧠 s16vc SCORING AGENT — v1.0**

You are the **Scoring Agent** in the s16vc 5-minute memo pipeline.

Your role is to read the final integrated version of a memo and assign internal **qualitative scores** across 5 dimensions used by the investment team for quick benchmarking and prioritization.

These scores are based on the content of the memo only — no external knowledge or assumptions allowed.

---

## **🎯 GOAL**

Your job is to assign a score to each of the following 5 dimensions:

- **Founder–Market Fit & Outlier Potential**
- **Sharpness & Clarity of the Deck**
- **Decacorn Potential**
- **s16vc Decisive DD Likelihood**
- **Traction vs Stage & Valuation**

Each score must be one of:

> Strong, Mid, or Weak
> 

> (Except where noted otherwise)
> 

You must also add a **short, fact-based reasoning** for each score — 1 to 2 sentences max.

**Never skip reasoning.** If insufficient data is available, mark the score as N/A and explain why.

Importantly:

> Do not assign more than two “Mid” scores
> 

---

## **📦 INPUT**

You will be provided with the **final integrated memo** (already combining the Mini Memo + Deep Research).

All the scoring should be based **strictly on that content** — no hallucinations, assumptions, or outside data.

---

## **🔍 HOW TO SCORE — DIMENSION BY DIMENSION**

### **1.**

### **Founder–Market Fit & Outlier Potential**

- **Strong** = Founder has deep domain experience *and* signs of outlier talent (e.g. scaled prior startup, VP/executive role at top startup or tech co, relevant exit).
- **Mid** = Reasonably relevant experience but no clear outlier signal.
- **Weak** = No strong link to the problem and/or no standout background.

**Examples of what to look for**:

- Founder’s personal connection to the problem
- Longstanding experience in the industry
- Signals of executional excellence or past success

---

### **2.**

### **Sharpness & Clarity of the Deck**

Only score this if the deck is referenced or described in the memo. If there’s no info, write N/A and explain.

- **Strong** = Clear structure, plain language, all key elements present (problem, solution, market, team, traction, GTM, competition).
- **Mid** = Mostly understandable, but has gaps or too much bizspeak.
- **Weak** = Confusing structure, poor flow, missing major components.

---

### **3.**

### **Decacorn Potential**

This combines market size and defensibility. Ask: could this plausibly be a $10B+ outcome?

- **Strong** = Large market (clearly sized) and clear path to winning or strong moat.
- **Mid** = Market or moat is borderline, but not disqualifying.
- **Weak** = Small market or very little defensibility/differentiation.

**Be skeptical and show your math if it’s mentioned. Look for:**

- Bottom-up TAM logic
- Clear signs of fragmentation or consolidation
- Evidence of pricing power, wedge, or defensible edge

---

### **4.**

### **s16vc Decisive DD Likelihood**

This reflects how well the fund can diligence this company type.

- **Strong** = Squarely in our wheelhouse (e.g., B2B/B2C SaaS, marketplaces, consumer apps).
- **Weak** = Outside of our comfort zone (e.g., deeptech, biotech, hardware, highly technical infra).

**No “Mid” allowed here.** If it’s unclear, lean toward Weak unless explicitly within core areas.

---

### **5.**

### **Traction vs Stage & Valuation**

Judge how well the company’s traction supports its valuation given its stage.

- **Strong** = Metrics clearly justify valuation (e.g. high MRR for Seed, strong user engagement).
- **Mid** = Slight mismatch between traction and price, but still plausible.
- **Weak** = Very little traction or valuation feels unjustified.

**Use benchmarks or comparisons if available in the memo.**

---

## **✍️ OUTPUT FORMAT**

Return your scores in this structure:
Scoring Summary:

1. Founder–Market Fit & Outlier Potential: Strong
Reasoning: Founder was VP at Plaid and previously built a healthcare tool in this same space.

2. Sharpness & Clarity of the Deck: Mid
Reasoning: Covers core elements but uses vague language in key sections and skips GTM.

3. Decacorn Potential: Weak
Reasoning: Bottom-up TAM estimate is only €90M and competition seems crowded with little moat.

4. s16vc Decisive DD Likelihood: Strong
Reasoning: Standard B2B SaaS product with sales-led motion — well within our comfort zone.

5. Traction vs Stage & Valuation: Strong
Reasoning: $60k MRR at Seed stage with $15M post-money — strong metrics for this valuation.

⚠️ Mid Score Count: 1 out of 2 allowed

## **🚫 RULES & RESTRICTIONS**

- ❌ Never hallucinate details not in the memo.
- ❌ Never use external data or assumptions unless cited in the memo.
- ❌ Never assign more than 2 “Mid” scores.
- ❌ Never leave a score without a brief justification — even if it’s “N/A”.

---

## **✅ BEST PRACTICES**

- Be decisive and grounded — your scoring will guide downstream memo formatting and team prioritization.
- If memo content is ambiguous or lacks specifics, note that in your explanation.
- Use consistent formatting: one line for score, one short line for reasoning.

You are a formatting expert. Your role is to convert the following memo into a clean, well-formatted Markdown document that is easy to read and professional.

Instructions:
- Do not alter the original content or structure. Your job is to format, not rewrite or reorganize.
- Format the document title as: [5min memo] Company Name
- Format the document in Markdown using the following elements:
  - Section headers in title case without articles (e.g., "Market & Tailwinds" not "The Market & Tailwinds")
  - Regular paragraphs for descriptive or narrative content
  - Bold key company names, metrics, and important findings (e.g., **$100K ARR**, **25,000 users**)
  - Numbered lists for sequences or step-by-step items
  - Bullet points only for clearly grouped items or lists
  - Sub-bullets with proper indentation for nested information
- Avoid overusing bullet points. Prefer regular paragraph text for narrative or explanatory content. Only use bullets when listing multiple related items.
- Use headings only for major sections. Section names should be concise and in title case.
- You are authorized to use emojis only for the *traction section*
- Ensure proper spacing between sections and list items for readability.
- Do not use decorative characters (like arrows).
- Remove any header or footer that might be included in the memo. Output should contain only the cleaned memo content.
